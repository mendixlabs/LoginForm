## Features

- Use this widget to enable **local users** to login from any page in your Mendix application
- A link to open a 'Forgot my password' page
 
## Limitations
- Input credentials are authenticated with user credentials available in System.User entity(local accounts). Logging in with Mendix SSO account credentials, using this widget, will not result in being logged in.
- In a Sandbox environment an application owner is not able to configure the MxAdmin account(=local). To log in with a MxAdmin account is not possible in a Sandbox.

## Configuration 
- Insert the widget in a page
- Configure the properties 

## Properties

### Display
* *Username placeholder* - Standard text to be displayed in username field
* *Password placeholder* - Standard text to be displayed in password field
* *Username Label* - Username label caption
* *Password Label* - Password label caption
* *Login button caption* - Text to be displayed on login button
* *Empty username/password message* - Feedback message shown when a user didn't provide all credentials
* *Forgot password link text* - Text to use in the Forgot password link

### Behaviour
* *Show progress bar* - Display a progress bar while signing in
* *Forgot password microflow* - Microflow being triggered in case of 'forgot password' onclick
* *Focus username input field* - Move focus to username field when the form is showed (only use this if it is not done automatically)
* *Login Failure Text* - Warning message to show when login fails twice

### Mobile
* *Auto capitalize* - Enables/disables auto capitalize functionality on username input field for mobile devices
* *Auto correct* - Enables/disables auto correct functionality on username input field for mobile devices
* *Username Keyboard Type* - The keyboard type to display when the user is entering their username

### Password
* *Show/mask password toggle* - Adds a toggle button to show/mask password.*
* *Show password button caption* - The caption that is used for the show button for the value of the password
* *Mask password button caption* - The caption that is used for the hide button for the value of the password
* *Show password button image* - Optional image to be displayed in 'Show password' button
* *Mask password button image* - Optional image to be displayed in 'Mask password' button

### Casehandling
* Convert to lower/uppercase - this option will convert user name input to upper/lower case. Using this functionality only makes practical sense when all usernames defined in your application are either upper or lower cased.
NOTE: MxAdmin administrative user will be accessible in both cases as well.

## Known issues
- Mendix runtime returns no feedback about the existence of a username. This is by design.
